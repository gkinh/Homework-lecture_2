                        <dt>3 reasons why i by at Student inc:</dt>
                        <li>Most modern companies have a strict hierarchy. Employees report to their superiors, they report to their bosses, and so on.<br>
                            In Student inc, this is not the case. Working with creative people, the company realized that ordering employees to do what they do not like is a futile exercise. They will not put all their efforts into achieving results if they do not like what they are doing. Therefore, in Student inc, everyone has the right to vote.</li>
                        <li>This company loves its employees. Stydent inc offers a wide range of benefits, including a variety of health care programs, retirement benefits, stock options incentives, parental leave for mothers and fathers, and much more.</li>
                        <li>And finally Student inc guarantees free meals. This company offers healthy and tasty dishes prepared with love every day.</li>
